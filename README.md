# Project Info
This project was done during a build week sprint at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com). Part time students stretch this build over two weeks. They have 9 class nights of 3 hours to work on the project, complete stand up meetings before every day and at the end of specified days, and one timed, multiple-choice assessment for the unit they have just completed. Students work in cross-functional teams using GitHub, Trello, Slack, and Zoom to facilitate remote work.
## Build Sprint Mission
>Empower students to demonstrate unit mastery over their learning objectives.
